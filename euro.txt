Europe, let's come together
(Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa)
It's now or never
I love you all (Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa)

[Chorus: Joost]
Welcome to Europe, stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa
Welcome to Europe, stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

[Verse 1: Joost]
Visit my friends in France or take a long walk to Vienna
I want to leave Netherlands, but my passport is gone
Fortunately, don't need a visa to be with you
So take the bus to Poland or the train to Berlin
I have no money for Paris, so use my imagination
Do you have a euro, please? Say "merci" and "please"
I lost everything except time
So I'm travelling every day 'cause the world is mine

[Chorus: Joost]
Welcome to Europe, stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa
Welcome to Europe, stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

[Post-Chorus: Joost]
Euro-pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Euro-pa-pa-pa (Hey)
Euro-pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Europa (Hey)

[Verse 2: Joost]
I am in Germany, but I am so alone
I am in Italy, but still, I feel pain
I'm running from myself, call for help all day long
Yeah, I even give people money, but there's no one to help me
I don't need escargots, don't need fish and chips
Don't need paella, no, I don't even know what that is
Turn on the radio, I hear Stromae with "Papaoutai"
Won't stop until they say, "Yes, yes, he does that very well, ayy"

[Chorus: Joost]
Welcome to Europe, stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa
Welcome to Europe, stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

[Post-Chorus: Joost]
Euro-pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Euro-pa-pa-pa (Hey)
Euro-pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Europa (Hey)


[Bridge: Joost & Tim Haars]
Europa, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa (Ja-ha)
Pa, pa, pa, pa (Hey)
Welcome to Europe, boy!

[Drop]

[Outro: Joost]
(Hey)
Eu-ro-pa
